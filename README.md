# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about) is a christmas coding challenge.

# Why are you doing historic AoC's?
Because they're a great way to practice you problem solving and programming skills.
I'll either go through all the historic questions is Deno or get bored and start doing them in some other language.
